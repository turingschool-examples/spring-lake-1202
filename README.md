## Overview

We are creating an application to track the maintenance of amusement park rides and mechanics working on those rides.

* AmusementParks have a name and price of admissions attributes
  * ex. `name: 'Six Flags', admission_cost: 75`
* Mechanics have a name and years of experience attributes
  * ex. `name: ‘Kara Smith’, years_experience: 11`
* Rides have a name, thrill rating, and open (boolean) attributes
  * ex. `name: ‘The Hurler’, thrill_rating: 7, open: false`
* AmusementParks have many Rides
* Rides belong to an AmusementPark
* Mechanics can work on many Rides
* Rides can have many Mechanics working on them

Some of the initial migrations and model set up has been done for you.

As a user,
When I visit a mechanic show page
I see their name, years of experience, and the names of all rides they are working on.

Story 2 - Add a Ride to a Mechanic

As a user,
When I go to a mechanic's show page
I see a form to add a ride to their workload
When I fill in that field with an id of an existing ride and click Submit
I’m taken back to that mechanic's show page
And I see the name of that newly added ride on this mechanic's show page.

Ex:
Mechanic: Kara Smith
Years of Experience: 11

Current rides they’re working on:
  The Frog Hopper
  Fahrenheit
  The Kiss Raise

Add a ride to workload:

Story 3 - Amusement Park Show page

As a visitor,
When I visit an amusement park’s show page,

## Extensions

```
Extensions - Amusement Park's Rides

As a visitor,
When I visit an amusement park's show page,
Then I see a list of all of the park's rides,
And next to the ride name I see the average experience of the mechanics working on the ride,
And I see the list of rides is ordered by the average experience of mechanics working on the ride.
(Note: you should only perform 1 database query to retrieve the list of rides with average mechanic experience)
